I deliberately have not installed PHP, MySQL or Apache on my laptop, which has forced me to learn to use Docker! The first tutorial I followed was the Docker docs get started after I installed Docker. I found this to be a useful introduction, even though I wanted a PHP environment, the guide still explained the basics of Docker.</description></item><item><title>Set up PhpStorm to use PHP with PHPUnit and xDebug in Docker</title><link>https://pen-y-fan.github.io/2020/10/10/Set-up-PhpStorm-to-use-PHP-with-PHPUnit-and-xDebug-in-Docker/</link><pubDate>Sat, 10 Oct 2020 17:01:32 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pen-y-fan.github.io/2020/10/10/Set-up-PhpStorm-to-use-PHP-with-PHPUnit-and-xDebug-in-Docker/</guid><description>I have recently configured my windows 10 laptop with an additional SSD, so I could experiment with Linux. I have already installed Pop!_OS Git, PhpStorm and Docker. I havenâ€™t installed PHP or Composer locally. Next I want to learn how to use this new environment. This is what I have found out so far.</description></item><item><title>Pop OS new install</title><link>https://pen-y-fan.github.io/2020/10/05/Pop-OS-new-install/</link><pubDate>Mon, 05 Oct 2020 20:14:38 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pen-y-fan.github.io/2020/10/05/Pop-OS-new-install/</guid><description>I wanted to test out Linux after I had purchased a new laptop which came with Windows 10 home. Although I was generally happy with my dev environment, I still wanted to try out Linux as a dev environment. I chose to try Pop OS as it was recommended by several people, especially on the PHPUgly and Syntax podcasts.</description></item></channel></rss>
